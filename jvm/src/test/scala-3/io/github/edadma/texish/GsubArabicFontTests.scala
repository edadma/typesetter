/** The full Arabic shaping pipeline, checked against the bundled Noto Naskh Arabic face: joining-form
  * resolution ([[ArabicShaping]]) feeding GSUB composition and form selection ([[Gsub]]) feeding GPOS mark
  * placement ([[Gpos]]). Like Noto's other Arabic faces, this font decomposes a dotted letter into a
  * dotless skeleton plus a separate dot through `ccmp`, selects the skeleton's connecting shape through the
  * `init`/`medi`/`fina`/`isol` features, and positions the dot with GPOS — so a correct render proves all
  * three stages cooperate. The parsers are pure shared code; this test reads the real font from disk.
